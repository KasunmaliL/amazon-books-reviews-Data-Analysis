# **Book Data Analysis Project**

A complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) project performed on a
dataset of books, including their prices, ratings, review counts,
authors, and review trends over time.\
This project aims to uncover meaningful insights about reader behavior,
book popularity, and factors influencing rating patterns.

## **Project Overview**

This project involves:

-   Data loading and cleaning\
-   Exploratory data analysis\
-   Visualization of rating trends, price relationships, and author
    performance\
-   Identification of key insights related to book ratings and reviews

The analysis was completed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook
environment, with libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**,
**Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains information such as:

-   Book title\
-   Author\
-   Price\
-   Rating\
-   Number of reviews\
-   Publication year\
-   Review helpfulness

These variables were used to explore user rating behavior and book
popularity.

## **Data Cleaning**

Key preprocessing steps:

-   Handling missing values\
-   Converting data types\
-   Removing invalid or inconsistent entries\
-   Formatting numeric and textual fields for analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis**

The project includes the following analyses:

### **1. Rating Distribution**

-   Most books receive **4-star or 5-star ratings**\
-   Fewer low ratings, indicating generally high reader satisfaction

### **2. Price vs Rating**

-   Weak or no correlation\
-   Both cheap and expensive books can have high ratings

### **3. Top-Rated Authors**

-   Identification of authors with:
    -   Highest average ratings\
    -   Largest number of reviews

### **4. Yearly Review Trends**

-   Increasing number of reviews over time\
-   Growth reflects rising user activity on online platforms

## **Key Insights**

-   Readers tend to give positive ratings overall\
-   Book price is **not** a strong predictor of rating\
-   Popular authors attract high review counts and strong ratings\
-   Reviews are growing year over year\
-   Helpful reviews are usually longer and more detailed
